## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Introduction to Productivity Tools


Generally speaking, we do not recommend the use of graphical user interfaces, GUIs, for data science projects.  In fact, to avoid using GUIs for data analysis, we have already learned to code in R. In this course, we describe an alternative to point and click approaches to organizing files and document preparation.  Specifically, we will learn to use freely available tools that, although at first may seem cumbersome and nonintuitive, will eventually make you a much more efficient and productive data scientist.  Three general guiding principles that motivate what we learn here are-- one, be systematic when organizing your file system; two, automize when possible; and three, minimize the use of the mouse. 
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/three general guilding principles that motivate what we learn are one.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/three general guilding principles that motivate what we learn are two.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/three general guilding principles that motivate what we learn are three.png)
 
As you become more proficient at coding, and you will find that-- one, you want to minimize the time you spend remembering what you call something or where you put it.  Two, if you find yourself repeating the same task over and over, there's probably a way to automize it.  And three, times your fingers leave the keyboard, it results in loss of productivity.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/minimize time spend looking for something.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/if you find repeating process, you should automize it.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/use keyboard is much more productive.png)
A typical data analysis challenge may involve several parts, each involving several data files, including files containing the scripts we use to analyze data.  Keeping all this organized can be challenging.  We will learn to use the Unix shell as a tool for managing files and folders on your computer system.  Using Unix will permit you to use the keyboard, rather than the mouse, when creating folders, moving from folder to folder, and renaming, deleting, or moving files.  We also provide specific suggestions on how to keep the file system organized.  

The data analysis process is iterative and adaptive.  As a result, we are constantly editing our scripts and reports. In this course, we introduce a new version control system, Git, which is a powerful tool for keeping track of these changes.  We also introduced you to GitHub, a service that permits you to host and share your code.  We will also demonstrate how you can use this service to facilitate collaborations.  Note that a side effect of using Github is that you can easily showcase your work to potential employers.  

[][Finally, we learned to write reports in R markdown], which permits you to incorporate text and code into a single document.  We will demonstrate how using the knitr package we can write reproducible and aesthetically pleasing reports by running the analysis and generating the report simultaneously.  We'll put all this together using the powerful integrated desktop environment RStudio.  Our first step is to install all the tools we need to do this.  All these tools are free.

# Section 1 Overview

The Installing Software section walks you through the steps to download and install R, RStudio, git (and git bash on Windows machines), create a GitHub account, and connect RStudio to GitHub.

There is a graded comprehension check at the end of the section.

If you get stuck, we encourage you to search the discussion boards for the answer to your issue or ask us for help!










# Installing Software

In this series of videos, we will describe how to install the software tools that we consider the main productivity tools.  To motivate the use of these tools, we will also provide brief illustrations of how we use them.  We will install the following software tools.  First, we'll install R, the programming language we use to analyze data.  Second, we'll install RStudio, the integrated desktop environment we use to edit, organize, and test our R scripts.  Third, we will install Git.  This is the version control system we use to keep track of changes made to our code and to sync local copies of our code with copies hosted on GitHub.  For Windows users, when you install Git, we will also install Git Bash, a piece of software that emulates Unix on Windows machines.  We will also show how to open a GitHub account and how to sync it with RStudio.  End of transcript. Skip to the start.

This video corresponds to the textbook introduction to productivity tools External link.
https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/introduction-to-productivity-tools.html


[][Key points]

We will install:

    R: the programming language we use to analyze data
    RStudio: the integrated desktop environment we use to edit, organize, and test R scripts
    Git (and Git Bash for Windows): version control system








# Installing R

RStudio is an interactive desktop environment, but it is not R, nor does it include R when you download and install it.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/RStudio is an interactive environment.png)
Therefore to use RStudio, we first need to install R. You can download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network or CRAN.  You can search for CRAN on your browser like this.  Once at the CRAN download page for your operating system, you will have several choices.  You want to install the base subdirectory.  This installs the basic packages you need to get going.  We will later learn how to install other needed packages from within R, rather than from this web page.  

Now click on the link to the latest version to start the download process.  If you're using Chrome, for example, you'll see at the bottom of your browser, a tab that shows you the progress of the download.  Once the installer file downloads, you can go ahead and click on that tab to start the installation process.  Other browsers may be different, so you'll have to find where they store downloaded files and click on them to get the process started.  Once the installation process starts, you can click through all the different choices to finish the installation.  

We highly recommend you select all the default choices, even when you get an ominous warning like this one.  If you're asked to select the language, consider that it will be easier to follow this course if you select English.  Continue selecting the default, and you'll eventually finish and install R.  Congratulations, you've installed R, although we highly recommend that beginners use R through RStudio, you can use R without RStudio.  You can start it like any other program.  If you follow the default installations on a Windows machine, a shortcut will appear on your desktop, which you can just double click to start R. On a Mac, R will be on the applications folders, just like any other program.  

If you start R without RStudio, you'll see an R console in which you can start typing commands.  This is what it looks like.  But we will be much more productive using an editor developed for coding, such as the one provided by RStudio.  In the next video, we demonstrate how to install RStudio.  End of transcript. Skip to the start.  



[][Textbook Link]

This video corresponds to the textbook section on installing R External link.
https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/installing-r-rstudio.html#installing-r


[][Key points]

    You need to install R before using RStudio, which is an interactive desktop environment.
    Select base subdirectory in CRAN and click download.
    Select all default choices in the installation process.
    We recommend selecting English for language to help you better follow the course.
    One can try using the R console, but for productivity purposes, we can switch to RStudio.

Download R from CRAN

You can find the latest version of R for your operating system at the CRAN website External link










# Installing RStudio

To install RStudio you can start by searching for RStudio on your browser.  You should find the RStudio website this way.  Once there, click on Download RStudio.  This will give you several options.  For what we do in this course, it is more than enough to use the free desktop version.  Once you select this option, it will take you to a page in which the operating system options are provided.  Once again, click on the link showing your operating system.  Once the installation file is downloaded, click on the downloaded file to start the installation process.  We recommend clicking Yes on all the defaults.  On the Mac, there are fewer clicks.  You basically drag and drop the RStudio icon into the application folder.  Congratulations.  You've installed RStudio.  End of transcript. Skip to the start.

https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/installing-r-rstudio.html#installing-rstudio


[][Key points]

    You can download the latest version of RStudio at the RStudio website External link.
    The free desktop version is more than enough for this course.
    Make sure to choose the version for your own operating system.
    Choose "Yes" for all defaults in the installation process.







# Using RStudio for the First Time


Now that you've installed R and RStudio, we're going to show you an example of how you use it.  You can start RStudio in Windows by going to the Start menu and searching for RStudio, and on the Mac, RStudio will be an application.  You can find it in the application folder.  Now for the Mac users, to avoid using the mouse to open RStudio or actually any other program, you can hit command spacebar to open the spotlight search and type RStudio into that search bar and then hit enter.  This will start RStudio.  When you start RStudio for the first time, you will see three panes.  The left pane shows you the R console.  On the right, the top pane includes three tabs, while the bottom pane shows you five tabs, file, plots, packages, help, and viewer.  

Here's what it looks like.  You can click on the different tabs to move across the different features.  Now let's start coding.  Let's start writing a new script.  To start a new script, you can click on file, then new file, then R script.  This starts a new pane on the left, and it is here where you can start writing your script.  Note that we use the mouse to do that.  Many tasks we perform with the mouse can be achieved with a combination of keystrokes instead.  

[][These keyboard versions of performing tasks are referred to as key bindings].  For example, we just showed you how to use a mouse to start a new script.  But you can also use a key binding.  On Windows, it's control shift N. On the Mac, it's command shift N. Although in this tutorial, we often show how to use a mouse, we highly recommend that you memorize key bindings for the operations you use the most.  RStudio actually provides a useful cheat sheet with the most widely used commands.  You can get it from RStudio directly like this, and this is what the cheat sheet looks like.  You might want to keep this handy so you can look up key bindings when you find yourself performing repetitive point and click tasks.  



[][Textbook Link]

This video corresponds to material in the textbook section on Getting Started External link.
https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/getting-started.html


[][Key Points]

    In Windows, search for Rstudio in "Start"
    In Mac, choose Rstudio from applications, or use Command+Space to use spotlight search to avoid using the mouse
    To start a new script: file > new file > Rscript (or using key bindings: Ctrl+Shift+N on Windows, and Command+Shift+N on Mac)
    Key bindings from Rstudio cheatsheet can be located with Help > cheatsheet > Rstudio IDE cheatsheet










## Course  /  Section 1: Installing Software  /  1.2 Introduction to RStudio


# Installing Packages


The default installation of R is quite minimal, and for many of your projects you'll need to download and install one or more packages.  You can install packages directly from R with the command [][install.packages()].  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/install.packages() in r.png)
To install the tidyverse package we would type, in the R console, install.packages open parentheses quotes tidyverse.  Know that we can install more than one package at once by feeding a character vector to this function.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/install multi packages, passin a list of strings.png)
So with this command we can install both tidyverse and the dslabs in one command.  You can also install packages using RStudio   using point and click in the following way.  One advantage of using RStudio is that it autocompletes package names once you start typing, which is helpful when you do not remember the exact spelling of the package.  Once you select your package, we recommend selecting all the defaults.  Note that installing tidyverse actually installs several packages.  Once packages are installed, you can load them into R and you do not need to install them again, unless you install a fresh version of R. Then you have to start again.  

[][Remember packages are installed in R, not RStudio].  It is helpful to have a script that installs all the packages you need because if you need to perform a fresh install of R, you can reinstall all your packages by simply running this script.  You can see all the packages you have installed using the following command.  End of transcript.  



[][Textbook link]

This video corresponds to the textbook section installing R packages External link.
https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/getting-started.html#installing-r-packages


[][Key points]

    We will be using tidyverse and dslabs packages for this course, which do not come preinstalled in base R.
    Install packages from R console: install.packages("pkg_name")
    Install packages from Rstudio interface: Tools > install packages (allow autocomplete)
    Once installed, we can use library("pkg_name") to load a package each time we want to use it

    Check the packages you have installed
    Good practice: make a script to install all the packages you need for a fresh R

Code

install.packages("dslabs")  # to install a single package
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "dslabs")） # to install two packages at the same time
installed.packages() # to see the list of all installed packages










# Running Commands While Editing Scripts

There are many editors, specifically made for coding.  These are useful, because color and indentation are automatically added to make code more readable.  RStudio is one of these editors, and it was specifically developed for R. One main advantage provided by RStudio over other editors is that we can test our code easily as we edit our scripts.  Here we show an example.  Let's start by opening a new script as we did before.  And next step is to give the script a name.  We can do this through the editor by saving the current new unnamed script like this.  You can do this by clicking on the icon, or you can use the keybinding control S on Windows or command S on the Mac.  We will call the script of myfirstscript.r like this.  

![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/you can try it out by sourcing in the code..png)
Now we're going to start editing our script.  The first lines of code in an R script are typically dedicated to loading the libraries we will use.  Another useful RStudio feature is that once you type library, it starts to auto complete with the libraries we have installed.  You can see that by trying it out yourself like this.  Type library parentheses TI, and see what happens.  Another feature you may have noticed is that when you type library parentheses, the second parentheses is automatically added.  This will help you avoid one of the most common errors in coding, forgetting to close parentheses.  Now you can continue to write code.  As an example, we will make a graph showing murder totals versus population totals by state as we did in another course.  Once you're done writing the code, needed to make this plot, you can try it out by sourcing in the code.  To do this, you can click on the run button on the upper right side of the editing pane.  You can also use the keybinding control shift enter on Windows and command shift return on the Mac, like this.  

Once you run the code, you will see it appears in the R console.  And in this case, the generated plot appears in the plot pane.  Note that the plot pane has a useful interface that permits you to click back and forward across different plots, zoom in into the plot or save the plot as a file.  One final little trick, if you want to test out code line by line, you can do this.  To run one line at a time, instead of the entire script, you can use control enter on Windows or command return on the Mac.  



[][Textbook link]

This video corresponds to the textbook section on RStudio External link.
https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/getting-started.html#rstudio


[][Key points]

    RStudio has many useful features as an R editor, including the ability to test code easily as we write scripts and several autocomplete features.
    Keyboard shortcuts:
        Save a script: Ctrl+S on Windows and Command+S on Mac
        Run an entire script:  Ctrl+Shift+Enter on Windows Command+Shift+Return on Mac, or click "Source" on the editor pane
        Run a single line of script: Ctrl+Enter on Windows and Command+Return on Mac while the cursor is pointing to that line, or select the chunk and click "run"
        Open a new script: Ctrl+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac

Code

library(tidyverse)


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data("murders")


murders %>%
  ggplot(aes(population, total, label=abb, color=region)) +
  geom_label()


# Control + Shift + Enter to run the code
# And Control + Enter to run code line, instead of code block
```











# Keeping Organized with RStudio Projects


A data analysis project is not always a data set and a script.  It often involves several scripts.  The data may be saved across different files, and it is often convenient to save intermediate files.  RStudio projects provide a way to keep all this organized in one folder.  We will later learn how RStudio facilities sharing work of these projects.  To organize yourself on a computer, it will be essential that you understand how your file system is organized.  A systematically organized file system can greatly increase your productivity, especially if you work on more than one project at a time.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/you want to organize your file system hierarchical approach.png)
In a later video, we introduce you to how Unix provides a powerful tool to do this.  In this video, we will create a folder in a default location for illustrative purposes.  But once you become a regular R user, you will want to think carefully about the best location for the folder in which you will keep a new project.  To start a project, you click on File and then New Project.  It looks like this.  And unless you have a pre-selected folder to save the work, you will select the New Directory option.  Then, for a data analysis project, you usually select the New Project option.  

Now, you will have to decide on the location of the folder it will be associated with your project and the name of the folder.  When choosing a folder name, make sure it has a meaningful name that will help you remember what the project is about.  As with files, we recommend using lower case letters, no spaces, and using hyphens to separate words.  We will call the folder for this project, just as an example, my-first-project.  Note that this will generate a file called my-first-project dot R-p-r-o-j--R project.  And the folder associated with that project.  We will see how this is useful shortly.  You will be given options on where this folder should be on your file system.  

In this example, we will place it in a Home folder, but this is generally not a good practice.  Later, we will learn better ways to do this.  As we will describe in more detail later, you want to organize your file system following a hierarchical approach.  And you might have a folder called Projects, where you keep a folder for each of your projects.  Now when you start using RStudio with a project, you will see in the upper right corner the project name.  This will remind you what project this particular RStudio session belongs to.  When you open an RStudio session with no project, it will say Project:(None).  When working on a project, all files will be saved and searched for in the folder associated with that project.  

Here, we show an example of a script that we wrote and saved with the name code.R. Note that if you use a meaningful name for the project, we can be a little bit less informative when picking names for the files.  Although we did not do it here, note that you can have several scripts open at once.  Another advantage of R projects is that it saves a file that if you click on it, it automatically opens the project.  This file will be in the folder where you started the project.  Once you get to that folder, you'll see are file with the suffix R-P-R-O-J, R project.  In this case, the file is called my-first-project.Rproj.  And you double click on it, and it starts RStudio on the project with the file that we were already editing.  



[][Textbook Link]

This video corresponds to the textbook section on RStudio projects External link.
https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/reproducible-projects-with-rstudio-and-r-markdown.html#rstudio-projects


[][Key points]

    RStudio provides a way to keep all the components of a data analysis project organized into one folder and to keep track of information about this project.
    To start a project, click on File > New Project > New repository > New project > decide the location of files and give a name to the project, e.g. "my-first-project". This will then generate a Rproj file called my-first-project.Rproj in the folder associated with the project, from which you can double click to start where you last left off.
    The project name will appear in the upper left corner or the upper right corner, depending on your operating system. When you start an RStudio session with no project, it will display "Project: (None)".












## Course  /  Section 1: Installing Software  /  1.3 Introduction to Git and GitHub


# Installing Git Introduction



Another great advantage of RStudio projects is that one can share them with collaborators or the public through GitHub.  To do this, we will need a piece of software named Git as well as access to a Unix terminal.  The installation process for Git is quite different for Mac and Windows.  We include both here.  Git is what we refer to as a version control system.  These are useful for tracking changes to files as well as coordinating the editing of code by multiple collaborators.  

We will later learn how to use GitHub, which is a hosting system for code.  You need Git to interact with GitHub.  Having your code, and more generally, data-science projects on GitHub is, among other things, a way to show employers what you can do.  Git is most effectively used using Unix, although one can also use it through RStudio.  In a later video, we describe Unix in more detail.  



[][Key points]

    Git is a version control system, tracking changes and coordinating the editing of code.
    GitHub is a hosting system for code, which can help with your career profile.
    Git is most effectively used with Unix, but it can also interface with RStudio.










# Installing Git


There are two videos about installing Git. You should watch the one that is appropriate for your machine.

    If you have a Windows machine, you will need to install Git and Git Bash. The first video walks you through this process.
    If you have a Mac, you will only need to install Git (which may already be installed on your system). The second video walks you through this process.



We're going to start by installing Git and Git Bash on Windows.  Now remember, this is only for Windows.  Mac users do not need to do this part.  There are several pieces of software that permit you to perform Unix commands on Windows.  We'll be using Git Bash as an interface with RStudio, and it is automatically installed when we install Git for Windows.  

To install Git, start by searching for Git for Windows on your browser and clicking on the link for git-scm.com.  This will take you to the download Git page from which you can download the most recent maintained build.  You can then start running the installer and agree to the license.  In one of the installation steps, you will be asked to pick the default editor for Git.  Unless you're already a VI or VIM user, here I recommend against selecting VIM, which might be the default.  If you do not recognize an editor you know among the options given, we recommend that you select Nano as your default editor for Git, since this is the easiest to learn.  [][The next installation decision is actually an important one].  This installation process installs Git Bash.  We recommend that you select Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows command prompt as this will permit you to learn Unix from within RStudio.  However, if you do this, some commands that run on your Windows command line will stop working.  If you do not use your Windows command line, then this should not be a problem.  Also, most, if not all, of these Windows command lines have a Unix equivalent that you will be able to use now.  

You can now continue selecting the default options.  You have now installed Git on Windows.  A final and important step is to change your preference in RStudio so that Git Bash becomes a default Unix shell in RStudio.  Remember, this is only for Windows users.  To check that you, in fact, are using Git Bash in RStudio, you can open a new terminal in RStudio like this, and it should look something like this.  Congratulations, you just installed Git and Git Bash for Windows.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/open a new terminal in rstudio windows.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/change bash in rstudio.png)




In this video, we're going to show you how to install Git for the Mac.  Before we show you the installation process, we introduce you to the terminal.  Macs already come with this terminal, and it can be used to learn Unix.  We can also use it to check if Git is already installed, and if it's not installed, start the installation process.  To open a terminal, you can use Command-Spacebar and then type terminal, or you can find it in the Utilities folder like this.  Once you start the terminal, you will see a console like this one.  You might have Git installed already.  

One way to check is by asking for the version by typing into the command line the following-- git --version.  If you get a version number back, it's already installed.  If not, you will get the following message, and you will be asked if you want to install it.  You should click Install.  This will take you through the installation process.  Once installed, you can check for the version again and it should show you something like this.  Congratulations.  You've installed Git on your Mac.

https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/accessing-the-terminal-and-installing-git.html#installing-git-and-git-bash-on-windows


[][Install on Windows]

    Download Git bash from https://git-scm.com/ External link
    When asked to choose the default editor for Git, we recommend choosing nano if you do not already know VIM.
    The "git and optional Unix tools from Windows" option will allow you to learn Unix from Rstudio, however, it might interfere with the Windows command line.
    Finally, change the Rstudio preference so that you are using Git bash as the terminal (only for Windows user).

Install on Mac

    Open the terminal, either from the utility folder or using Cmd+space, and check if you already have Git installed by typing git --version in the command line.
    If you already have Git installed, you will be shown the version number after executing the above. If you do not have Git installed already, you will be prompted to do so.











# GitHub


The next step is to get a GitHub account.  Basic GitHub accounts are free.  The first step is to go to GitHub.com where you'll see a box like this one that you can use to sign up.  When signing up, you want to pick a name carefully.  You want it to be short, easy to remember and spell, somewhat related to your name, and professional.  The last one is important since you might be sending potential employers a link to your GitHub account.  Here, we're going to open an account as an example.  In this one, I'm going to sacrifice on the ease of spelling to incorporate my name.  Initials and last name is usually a good choice.  That's what I'm going to use.  If you have a very common name, then this account might be taken.  So you might have to add numbers or spell out part of your name.  The account I use for my own research, rafalab, is the same one I use for my web page and Twitter, which makes it easy to remember for those that follow my work.  

![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/using SSH RSA key to connect your GitHub account.png)
[][Once you have a GitHub account, you're ready to connect RStudio to this GitHub account].  You start by going to the global options and selecting Gitsvn.  You then need to enter the path for the Git executable we just installed.  But you should find it by browsing your system as this an change from system to system.  Now, to avoid entering our GitHub password every time we want to try to access our repository from RStudio, we'll create what is called an SSHRSA Key.  RStudio can do this for us automatically if we click on the Create RSA key button, like this.  And then RStudio and GitHub should now be able to connect and we're ready to create our first GitHub code repository.  



[][Textbook link]

This video corresponds to the textbook section on GitHub accounts External link.
https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/git.html#github-accounts


[][Key points]

    Sign up for a GitHub account, with a name that is professional, short, and easy to remember
    Connect to RStudio: global options > Git/SVM, enter the path to git executables
    To avoid typing our GitHub password every time, we create a SSH/RSA key automatically through RStudio with the create RSA key button.










# GitHub Repositories

In this video, we're going to show how to create a GitHub repository, or repo for short.  The general idea is that you will have at least two copies of your code--one on your computer and one on GitHub.  If you add collaborators to this project, then each will have a copy on their own computer.  The GitHub copy is usually considered the master copy that each collaborator syncs to.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/The GitHub copy is usually considered the master copy.png)
Git will help you keep all the different copies synced.  As mentioned, one of the advantages of keeping code on a GitHub repository is that you can easily share it with potential employers.  Because many data science companies use version control systems like Git to collaborate on projects, they might also be impressed that you already know at least the basics.  The first step in creating a repo for your code is to initialize one on GitHub.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/The first step in creating a repo for your code is to initialize one one Github.png)
Because you already created an account, you can go to the URL, GitHub.com/yourusername.  To create a repo, first log into your account by clicking on the sign in button on GitHub.com.  Watch out, you might already be logged in.  And if you are, you can skip this step.  You won't see a sign in button at the top.  If signing in, you'll have to enter your username and password.  We recommend you set up your browser to remember to avoid typing it each time.  Once on your account, you can click on Repositories.  Then you click on New to create a new repo.  

You will then want to choose a good descriptive name for the project.  Remember that in the future, you might have dozens of repos, so keep that in mind when choosing a name.  Here, to keep it simple.  We will use the name Homework-0.  Now you'll get asked what kind of repo you want.  We recommend you make the repo public.  If you want to keep it private, you'll have to pay a monthly charge.  You now have your first repo on GitHub.  Now we're going to connect it to RStudio.  So to do this, it is convenient to copy the link provided by GitHub specifically to connect this repo using Git.  We do it like this.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/copy the link provided by GitHub specifically to connect this repo using Git..png)

This video corresponds to the textbook section on GitHub Repositories External link.
https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/git.html#github-repos


[][Key points]

To create a new GitHub repository and link it to an RStudio project, follow 2 steps:

Step 1: Initialize a new repo on GitHub by clicking repository > new > choose a descriptive name.

Step 2: Connect to RStudio (next video).











# RStudio, Git, and GitHub

We are now ready to clone our repo, start editing files on our computer, and syncing with GitHub Help.  We will use RStudio to facilitate this, and we'll use Unix for the first time.  Our first step is to let Git know who we are.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/we use the git config command to tell who we are, We will type the following two commands into our terminal window..png)
This will make it easier to connect with GitHub help.  We started by opening a terminal window in RStudio or you can open an independent one.  Now, we use the git config command to tell who we are.  We will type the following two commands into our terminal window.  [][You need to use the email account you use to open your GitHub account so that they can get connected].  If you use the RStudio terminal, the RStudio session should look something like this.  Now, we're ready to start on RStudio project that uses version control and stores the code on GitHub.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/we are ready to start on RStudio project that uses version control and stores the code on GitHub, To do this we start a project, but instead of New Directory,.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/Here we use the following Git repository URL..png)
To do this we start a project, but instead of New Directory, we will instead select Version Control like this.  Then we will select Git as our version control system.  Now, we're asked for a repository URL.  This is that URL we copied earlier.  We put this into that box.  Here we use the following Git repository URL.  And in the project directory name, you put the name of the folder that was generated, which in our example, will be the name of the repo that we generated in GitHub called homework-0.  Note that this will create a folder called homework-0 on your local system.  Once you do this, the project is created, and it is aware of the connection to GitHub.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/If you select this tab, it will show you the files on your project with some icons.png)
You will see on the top right corner, the name and type of project and a new tab on the upper right pane title Git.  If you select this tab, it will show you the files on your project with some icons that give you information about these files and their relationship to GitHub repo.  In this example, we already added the files to the folder called code.R.  If you don't have one, you can add one.  And then you can see in the editing pane that that code is being edited.  We now need to pay attention to the Git pane.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/It is important to know that your local files and the GitHub repo will not be synced automatically.png)
It is important to know that your local files and the GitHub repo will not be synced automatically.  You have to do this when you're ready.  To truly understand all this, we need to learn more details about Git which we will do later.  Right now, we will quickly show you how to sync with this simple example.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/The main actions on Git are to pull changes from the remote repo, in this case the github repo, add files.png)
[][The main actions on Git are to "pull" changes from the remote repo, in this case the GitHub repo, ]
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/The main actions add files, or stage files,.png)
[]["add" files, or as we say in the Git lingo--stage files-- ]
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/The main action, commit changes to the local repo,.png)
[]["commit" changes to the local repo, ]
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/The main action, and push changes to the remote repo..png)
[][and "push" changes to the remote repo].  These are words you're going to see, if you're using Git--pull, add, commit, and push.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/These are words you're going to see, if you're using Git--pull, add, commit, and push.png)
Before we start working on collaborative projects, [][usually the first thing we do is pull in the changes from the remote repo], in our case, the one to GitHub.  However, for the example shown here, we're starting with an empty repo and we know that there's no changes to pull.  So we're going to skip that step here.  In RStudio, the status of the files as they relate to the remote and local repos are represented with status symbols and colors.  A yellow square means that Git knows nothing about this file.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/A yellow square means that Git knows nothing about this file..png)
[][*To sync with the GitHub repo.  We need to add the file, then commit the changes to our local get repo, then push the changes to the GitHub repo*].  Right now, the file is just on our computer.  To add the file using RStudio, we click on the *stage box*.  You will see that the status icon now change is to a green "a," it's been added.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/To add the file using RStudio, we click on the stage box..png)
Note, we're only adding the code.R file.  *We don't necessarily need to add all files in our local repo to the GitHub repo.  Only the ones that we want to keep track of or the ones we want to share*.  If our work is producing files of a certain type that we don't want to keep track of, we can add the suffix that defines these files in the gitignore file.  This is a bit advanced and you can find more details on it in the link provided here.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/If our work is producing files of a certain type that we dont want to keep track of, we can use suffix.png)
These files will stop appearing in your RStudio Git pane.  For the examples shown here, we'll only be adding the code.R file.  But in general for an RStudio project, we recommend adding both the .gitignore and the .rproject files.  Now, we're ready to commit the file to our local repo.  In RStudio, we can use the Commit button.  This will open a new dialog window.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/In RStudio, we can use the Commit button..png)
[][With Git, whenever we commit a change, we are required to enter a comment describing the change being committed].  In this case, we'll simply describe that we are adding a new script.  And this dialog box, RStudio also gives you a summary of what you're changing to GitHub repo.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/in RStudio we can use the commit button, This will open a new dialog window..png)
In this case because it's a new file, the entire file is highlighted as green which highlights the changes.  Once we hit the Commit button, we should see a message from it with a summary of the changes that were committed.  Now, we're ready to push these changes to the GitHub repo.  We can do this by clicking on the Push button on the top right corner.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/Once we hit the Commit button, we should see a message from it.png)
Now, we see a message from just letting us know that the push has succeeded.  Note that in the pop-up window we no longer see code.R.  This is because this file has not changed since our last push.  We can exit this pop-up window now and continue working on our code.  If we now visit our repo on the web, we will see that it matches our local copy.  Congratulations, you have successfully created a GitHub code repository.  

Soon, we will learn how to use this to keep us organized while sharing our code.  Now, before we continue learning about Git, we will provide a brief introduction to Unix and how it is used to keep organized.

Absolute path vs. relative path

A full path specifies the location of a file from the root directory. It is independent of your present directory, and must begin with either a “/” or a “~”. In this example, the full path to our “project-1” file is: 

/home/projects/project-1

A relative path is the path relative to your present working directory. If our present working directory is the “projects” folder, then the relative path to our “project-1” file is simply: 

project-1
Path shortcuts

One period “.” is your current working directory

Two periods “..” is the parent directory (up one from your present working directory) 

A tilde “~” is your home directory.
More path examples

Example 1.     Your current working directory is ~/projects and you want to move to the figs directory in the project-1 folder

    Solution 1: cd ~/projects/project-1/figs (absolute)
    Solution 2:  cd project-1/figs (relative)

Example 2.     Your current working directory is ~/projects and you want to move to the reports folder in the docs directory

    Solution 1: cd ~/dos/reports (absolute)
    Solution 2: cd ../docs/reports (relative)

Example 3.     Your current working directory is ~/projects/project-1/figs and you want to move to the project-2 folder in the projects directory.

    Solution 1: cd ~/projects/project-2 (absolute)
    Solution 2: cd ../../project-2 (relative)












## Course  /  Section 2: Basic Unix  /  2.1 Introduction to Unix


# Organizing with Unix


Unix is the operating system of choice in data science.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/Unix.png)
We'll introduce you to an approach and a way of thinking using an example showing how we keep a data-analysis project organized.  We will learn some of the most commonly used commands along the way.  However, we won't go into the details here.  We highly encourage you learn more.  Specifically when you find yourself using the mouse too much or performing a repetitive task, there's probably a more efficient way to do it in Unix.  

We provide some links to some courses you can take to learn more about Unix.  Note that there are many courses as well as very informative reference books.  We also provide some links.  When searching for Unix resources, keep in mind that other terms that are used to describe what we're going to learn here are *Linux*, *the shell*, and *the command line*.  

Basically what we're learning is a series of commands and a way of thinking that facilitates the organization of files without using the mouse.  To serve as motivation, we're going to start constructing a directory using Unix tools in RStudio.

# The Terminal 


The terminal is our window into the Unix world.
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/the terminal is our window into unix world.png)
Instead of clicking, dragging, and dropping to organize our files and folders, we'll be typing commands into the terminal.  We'll do this in the terminal similar to how we type commands into the R Console. But now instead of generating plots and statistical summaries, we'll be organizing files on our system.  

We have already described how we access the terminal using RStudio {*Alt + Shift + R*}, namely by going to Tools, then Terminal, then New Terminal.  But often, we want to access the terminal and have no need for RStudio.  We already described how to access the terminal on the Mac by going to the Utilities folder and clicking on the Terminal or by using spotlight to find the terminal.  On Windows, assuming you installed Git Bash, we can also access a terminal without RStudio by running the Git Bash program like this.  

Once you have a terminal open, you can start typing commands.  You should see a blinking cursor at the spot where what you type will show up.  This position is called the command line.  Once you type something and hit Enter on Windows or Return on the Mac,
Unix will try to execute this command.  If you want to try out an example, type this into your command line.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/The command echo is similar to cat in R..png)
The command echo is similar to cat in R. And executing this line should print out "Hello world," and then return back to the command line.  Note that you can't use the mouse and move around the terminal.  You have to use the keyboard.  To go back to a command you previously typed, you can use the up arrow.  Throughout the next videos, we're going to be showing you how to use Unix.  You're going to be seeing code in your screen.  You can try it out on your own computer.  



[][Textbook link]

This video corresponds to the textbook section on the terminal External link.
https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/unix.html#the-terminal


[][Key points]

    The terminal helps to organize files in the system.
    On Mac, use utilities > terminal.
    On windows, use Git bash program.
    Use the keyboard to navigate the command line.

Code: 

echo "hello world"












# The Filesystem

We refer to all the files, folders, and programs on your computer as the filesystem.  Note that folders and programs are also file, but this is a technicality we rarely think about and ignore in this course.  We'll focus on files and folders for now and discuss programs, or executables as we call them in Unix, in a later video.  The first concept you need to grasp to become a Unix user is how your file system is organized.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/Here's a visual representation of the structure we're describing..png)
You should think of it as a series of nested folders each containing files, folders, and executables.  Here's a visual representation of the structure we're describing.  In Unix, we refer to folders as [][directories].  Directories that are inside other directories are often referred to as subdirectories.  So for example, in this figure, the directory Docs has two subdirectories-- reports and resumes.  And Docs is a subdirectory of Home.  The Home directory is where all your stuff is kept.
In this figure, the directory called Home represents your home directory, but that is rarely a name that is used.  

On your system, the name of your home directory is likely the same as your username on that system.  Here's an example on Windows showing a home directory.  In this case, the home directory is called rafa, that's my username.  Here's an example on the Mac.  Now back to the figures showing the filesystem.  Suppose you're using a point and click system, and you want to remove the file cv.tex.  Suppose that on your screen, you can see the home directory.  

To erase this file, you would double click on the Home directory, then double click on Docs, then double click on resumes, and then drag cv.tex to the trash.  Here you are experiencing the hierarchical nature of the system.  cv.tex is a file inside the Resumes directory, which is a subdirectory inside the Docs directory, which is a subdirectory of the Home directory.  Now suppose you can't see the Home directory on your screen.  You would somehow need to make it appear on your screen.  One way to do it is to navigate from what is called the root directory all the way to your home directory.  

Any filesystem will have what is called the root directory, which is the directory that contains all directories on your system.  The home directory shown in this figure will usually be two or more levels from the root.  On Windows, you will have a structure like this.  On a Mac, it will be something like this.
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/The home directory shown in this figure will usually be 2 or more levels from the root.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/On a Mac, it will be something like this..png)

[][Key points:]

    We refer to all the files, folders, and programs (executables) on your computer as the filesystem.
    Your filesystem is organized as a series of nested folders each containing files, folders, and executables. (see the visualization in the textbook)
    In Unix, folders are referred to as directories and directories that are inside other directories are often referred to as subdirectories. 
    The home directory is where all your stuff is kept.  There is a hierarchical nature to the file system.
    Note for Windows Users: The typical R installation will make your Documents directory your home directory in R. This will likely be different from your home directory in Git Bash. Generally, when we discuss home directories, we refer to the Unix home directory which for Windows, in this book, is the Git Bash Unix directory.












# Working Directory

The concept of a current location is part of the point and click experience.  At any given moment, we're in a folder and see the content of that folder.  As you search for a file, as we did in the previous video, you experience the concept of a current location.  Once you double click on a directory, you change locations and now are in that folder, as opposed to the folder you were before.  In Unix, we don't have the same visual cues.  But the concept of a current location is indispensable.  We refer to this as the working directory.  Each terminal window you have open has a working directory associated with it.  And how do we know what is your working directory?  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/unix command pwd is nor present working directory.png)
The first command we learn in Unix is pwd, which stands for Print Working Directory.  And it answers this question.  It returns to working directory.  You can open a terminal and type pwd, and you will see your home directory.  Note that the working directory will be different in every system.  So you shouldn't expect to have the same result as what we get here.  If you open a terminal and type pwd as your first command, you should see something like /Users/yourusername on a Mac or something like /c/Users/yourusername on Windows.  

The character string returned by calling pwd represents your working directory.  When we first open a terminal, it will start in our home directory.  So in this case, the working directory is the same as a home directory.  Note that the forward slashes in the strings that we just showed separate directories.  So for example, the location-- /c/Users/rafa implies that our working directory is called rafa, and it is in a subdirectory called users, which is in a subdirectory called c.  And this is a subdirectory of the root directory.  The root directory is therefore represented by just a forward slash.  

We refer to strings returned by pwd as the [][full path] of the working directory.  The name comes from the fact that this string spells out the path you need to follow to get to the directory in question from the root directory.  Every directory has a full path.  Later, we will learn about [][relative paths], which tell us how to get to a directory from the working directory.  Note that in Unix, we use the shorthand ~ as a nickname for your home directory.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/Note that in Unix, we use the shorthand ~ as a nickname of your home directory.png)
So for example, if docs is in the path to a directory in your home directory, docs can be written as ~/docs.  Most terminals will show the path to your working directory right on the command line.  If you're using default settings and open a terminal on the Mac, you will see that right at the command line you have something like computername:~username, with ~ representing your working directory, which, in this example, is a home directory.  The same is true for Git Bash terminals, where you will see something like username@computername MINGW64 ~, with the working directory at the end.  Soon we're going to learn how to change directories using Unix.  When we change directories, we'll see that this home directory representation on your terminal will change on both Macs and Windows.  



C:\Users\qp>pwd
/c/Users/qp


qp@DESKTOP-K4FCGPH MINGW64 ~
$ pwd
/c/Users/qp

[][Key points]

    The working directory is the current location.
    Each terminal window has a working directory associated with it.
    The "pwd" command will display your working directory. The "/" symbol separates directories, while the first "/" at the beginning of the path stands for the root directory. When a path starts with "/", it is a "full path", which finds the current directory from the root directory. "Relative path" will be introduced soon.
    "~" means the home directory.

# Unix Commands


We will now learn a series of Unix commands that will permit us to prepare a directory for a data science project.  However, we're going to be typing commands that may not work on your system.  This is because every system is different.  For the code we're going to be typing here, we're going to be assuming the file system in this figure.  Your file system is different.  In a later video, we'll provide examples that you can actually type in.  

The first command we're going to learn is ls.  In a point and click system, we know what is in a directory because we see it.  In the terminal, we don't see the icons.  Instead, we use the command ls to list the directory content.  To see the content of your home directory, open a terminal and type [][ls].  We will see more examples soon.  Next, commands are [][mkdir] and [][rmdir].  When we're preparing for a data science project, we'll need to create directories.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/In Unix, we can do this with a command mkdir,.png)
In Unix, we can do this with a command mkdir, which stands for "make directory."  Because you will soon be working on several projects, we highly recommend creating a directory called projects in your home directory.  And you store all your project related directories in that bigger projects directory.  You can try this particular example in your system.  Open a terminal and type mkdir projects.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/we highly recommend creating a directory called projects in your home directory..png)
If you do this correctly, nothing will happen.  No news is good news in Unix.  But note that if the directory projects already exist, you will get an error message, and the existing directory will remain untouched.  To confirm that you created these directories, you can list the directory's contents like this.  You type ls.  You should see the directories you just created.  You might also see a lot of other directories that come preinstalled on your computer.  Let's make a few more other directories just for illustrative purposes.  You can do this by typing mkdir docs and teaching.  Those are the names of the two directories were going to create.  You can check to see if the three directories were created by typing ls.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/If you made a mistake and need to remove the directory,.png)
If you made a mistake and need to remove the directory, you can use the command rmdir.  Here's an example.  I'm going to make a directory called junk, and I'm going to remove it using rmdir.  This will remove the directory as long as it's empty.  If it's not empty, you will get an error message, and the directory will remain untouched.  To remove directories that are not empty, we will learn about another command called [][rm].  

Next, we want to create directories inside directories we have created, but we want to avoid pointing and clicking our way through the file system.  Instead, we're going to learn how to do this in Unix using the command line.  Suppose we open a terminal.  Our working directory is our home directory.  We want to change our working directory to projects.  We do this using the [][CD] command, which stands for change directory.  So we simply type cd projects, like this.  To check the working directory changed, we can use a command we previously learned, pwd.  Our working directory should be home directory slash projects.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/our working directory should be now home directory slach projects.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/notice in unix, you can auto complete with tab key.png)
Before we continue, an important tip--note that, in Unix, you can auto complete by hitting Tab.  This means that we can type cd, the letter d, and then hit Tab.  And on Unix, it'll either auto complete to docs if it's the only directory or file starting with the letter "D," or show you the options.  Try it out.  Using Unix without autocomplete will make it unbearable.  All right.  Let's continue.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/in unix full path start with a slash or a tilde.png)
When using CD, we can either type the [][full path], which will start with a slash or a tilde, or a relative path.  In the example we just showed in which we typed *cd projects*, we used a [][relative path].  *If the path you type does not start with a forward slash or a tilde, Unix will assume you're typing a relative path, meaning that it will look for the directory in your current working directory*.  So something like this will give you an error, cd users.  There is no directory called users in your working directory.  So you get an error.  

Now suppose we want to move back to the directory in which projects is a subdirectory.  This is referred to as a parent directory.  We could use the full path of the parent directory, but Unix provides a shortcut for this.  The parent directory of the working directory is represented with two dots.  So to move back, we simply type cd dot dot.  You should now be back in your home directory, which you can confirm using pwd.  Because we can use full path to cd, the following command, [][cd tilde], will always take us back to the home directory, no matter where we are in the file system.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/cd tilde will always take us to the home directory.png)
Note that **the working directory also has a nickname, and it is a single dot**.  So if you type cd dot, you will not move.  Although this particular use of dot is not useful, this nickname does come in handy sometimes.  We'll learn an example later.  So we have learned that, when using cd, we either stay put, move to a new directory using the desired directory's name, or move back to the parent directory using dot dot.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/now what we have learned is using cd to change working directory forward and backwrod.png)
Now, let's learn something that makes it a little bit more efficient to move around.  Note that when typing directory names, we can concatenate directories with forward slashes.  So if we want a command that takes us to the projects directory no matter where we are in the file system, we can type cd tilde forward slash projects, which is equivalent to writing the entire path out.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/takes us to the project directory no matter where we are.png)
For example, in a Windows system, we would write something like cd slash c slash users slash your username slash projects.  The last two commands are equivalent, and, in both cases, we're typing the full path.  When typing out the path of a directory you want-- either full or relative-- we can concatenate directories with forward slashes.  We already saw that we can move to project directory regardless of where we are by typing the full path.  We can also concatenate directory names for relative paths.  So, for example, *if you want to move back to the parent directory of the parent directory of the current working directory, we can type cd dot dot slash dot dot*.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/you can use cd - to go back to whatever dir you just left.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/if you just type cd will return to home directory.png)
A couple of final tips related to the cd command.  First, you can go back to whatever directory you just left by typing cd minus.  This can be useful if you type a very long path and then realize you want to go back to where you were and are too far away, and you have to type too much.  A second tip-- if you just type cd, you will return to your home directory.  Now let's explore some examples of using cd.  To help visualize, we will show a graphical representation of your file system like this.  OK.  So let's look at some examples.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/Suppose our working directory is tilde slash projects,.png)
Suppose our working directory is tilde slash projects, and we want to move to the figs directory in the project-1 directory.  Here, it is convenient to use relative paths, so we would type [][cd project-1 slash figs].  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/One way is to use relative paths, which would be cd dot dot slask docs slash reports.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/Another way is to use the full path. type cd tilde slask docs slash reports.png)
Now suppose our working directory is slash projects, and we want to move to reports in the docs directory.  How can we do this?  One way is to use relative paths, which would be cd dot dot slash docs slash reports.  Another is to use the full path.  So we can type cd tilde-- that's the home directory-- slash docs slash reports.  If trying this out on your system, remember auto complete.  One more example-- suppose we're in tilde slash projects slash project-1 slash figs, and we want to change tilde slash project slash project-2.  Again, there are two ways.  With relative paths, we can type cd dot dot slash dot dot slash project-2.  With full path, we would type cd tilde slash projects slash project-2.

# mv and rm: Moving and Removing Files

On a point and click system, we move files from one directory to another by dragging and dropping.  On Unix, we use the move command, the [][mv command].  Now, a warning the move command will not ask you are you sure.  So if your move results in overwriting a file, you lose the file.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/So if your move results in overwriting a file, you lose the file..png)
Now that how to use full and relative of paths, using move is relatively straightforward.  The general form is move path to the file you want to move and then path to the destination directory.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/for example, if we want to move the file cv.tex tech from Resumes.png)
So, for example, if we want to move the file cv.tex tech from Resumes to Reports, you could use the full paths like this--[][mv ~/docs/resumes/cv.tex ~/docs/reports/].  You can also use relative paths, so you could do this--cd ~/docs/resumes and then mv cv.tex to ../report/.  Or you could also do this-- cd ~/~/docs/reports/ then mv ../cv.tex/ ./.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/Note that in this last one we use the working directory shortcut,.png)
*Note that in this last one we use the working directory shortcut, dot, to give a relative path as the destination directory*.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/We can also use move to change the name of a file..png)
We can also use move to change the name of a file.  To do this **instead of the second argument being the destination directory, it is also a filename**.  So, for example, to change the name from cv.tex resume.tex, we simply type, first, we get to the directory they're in-- cd ~/~/docs/resumes and then we move it.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/first get to the directory then mv cv.tex to resume.tex..png)
mv cv.tex to resume.tex.  Note that we can combine a move and rename.  For example, here we're going to change cv.tex to resume.tex, but we're going to put in another directory.  So first we go to the directory where it is--cd ~/~/docs/resumes then we move cv.tex to the new directory with the file name at the end-- ../reports/resume.tex.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/note than we can combine a move and rename, can you see it.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/cd tilde slasj docs slash resumes then we move cv.tex to the new directory with the file name.png)
[][We can also move entire directories].  So to move the resume directory into the reports directory, we could do something like this--mv ~/docs/resumes to ~/~/docs/reports/.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/move tilde slash docs slash resume to tilde slash docs slash reports slash.png)
**It is important to add that last slash to make it clear that you do not want to rename the resumes directory to reports but rather move it into the reports directory**.  

![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/The copy command cp behaves similar to the move command,.png)
The copy command cp behaves similar to the move command, except that instead of moving we copy the file, meaning that the original file stays untouched.  So in all the mv examples we just saw, we can switch mv to cp, and they will copy instead of move with one exception.  We can't copy entire directories without learning about arguments.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/We can't copy entire directories without learning about arguments..png)
In a point and click systems, we remove files by dragging and dropping them into the trash or using some special click on the mouse.  In Unix, we use a command rm.  Warning-- unlike throwing files into the trash, rm is permanent so be careful.  The general way it works is like this-- you type rm and then the filename.  We can actually list files that we want to remove like this-- you type rm file one, file two, file three.  You can use full or relative paths.  Now to remove directories, you'll have to learn about arguments which we will do later.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/Now to remove directories, you'll have to learn about arguments.png)

    The rm command removes files.
    [warning] rm is permanent, which is different than throwing a folder in the trash.

# less: Looking at a File

Looking at files in Unix--often you want to quickly look at the content of a file.  If this file is a text file, the quickest way to do this is by using the command less.  So for example, to look at the file cv.tec, you would do something like this.  After moving to the directory where it resides, you just type "less cv.tec."  This will open up the less viewer.  To exit the viewer, you type q.  To move up and down the file, you use the arrows.  

Now there are many other keyboard commands you can use with less-- for example, to search or to jump pages.  You will learn more about this in a later section when you learn how to learn about commands.  Now if you're wondering why the command is called "less,"  It is because the original was called "more," as in "show me more of this file."  The second version was called "less" because of the saying "less is more."  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/The second version was called less because of the saying less is more.png)

# Preparing for a Data Science Project

We are now ready to prepare a directory for a project.  You should start by creating a directory where you'll keep all your projects.  We recommend a directory called "projects" in your home directory.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/we recommend a directory called projects in your home directory.png)
To do this, you would type cd ~ to get to your home directory and then use mkdir to create the projects directory.  Our projects, the ones we're going to work on here as an example, relates to gun violence murders.  *So we will call the directory, "murders."  It will be a subdirectory in our projects directories.  In the murders directories we'll create two subdirectories to hold the raw data and intermediate data.  We'll call these "data and "rda," respectively.  RDA stands for R Data*.  

So open a terminal and make sure you are in the home directory.  So you can type cd ~ if you're not sure.  Now we run the following commands to create the directory structure you will want.  At the end, we'll use ls and pwd to confirm we have generated the correct directories and we have moved to the correct working directory.  So we're going to type this; cd projects, mkdir murders, cd murderers, and then mkdir data rda.  Now we can use ls and pwd to confirm.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/we're going to type this; cd projects, mkdir murders, cd murderers,.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/Note that the full path of our murders data set is tilde slash projects slash murders..png)
Note that the full path of our murders data set is [][~/projects/murders].  So if we open a new terminal and want to navigate into this directory, we type cd projects/murders.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/after creating project based on existing directory, our default working directory will be tilde slash projects slash murders..png)
Now, in *RStudio when you start a new project, you can pick existing directory instead of new directory.  And write the full path of the murders directory like this*.  Once you do this, you will see that rda and data directories you created are in the files tab.  An important note, when you are in this project, our default working directory will be ~/projects/murders.  You can confirm this by typing [][getwd()] function into your R session.  This is important because it will help us organize the code when we need to write file paths.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/You can confirm this by typing getwd into your R session..png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/always use relative paths when you're working on a data science project.png)
Here's an important tip, in your R code, always use relative paths when you're working on a data science project and relative path to a default working directory.  The problem with using full paths, is that your code is unlikely to work on file systems other than your own, as other directory structures change.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/the problem with using full paths is, its unlikely to work on file systems other than your own,.png)
So this includes using the home directory.  [][You do not want to use the ~ in your code].  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/Let's call this file download-data.R..png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/The content of this file will be this..png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/Let's call this file download-data.R. The content of this file will be this..png)

All right, now let's write some scripts to download a file into the data directory.  Let's call this file [][download-data.R]. The content of this file will be this.  Note that we're using the relative path, data/murders.csv for the name of the file we're creating.  You can run this code in R and you'll see that a file is added to the data directory.  Now we're ready to write a script to read this data and prepare a table that we can use for further analysis.  
```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafalab/dslabs/master/inst/extdata/murders.csv"
dest_file <- "data/murders.csv"
download.file(url, destfile = dest_file,  method = "libcurl")
```
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/the new file wrangle-data.R. The content of this file will be this..png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/using this a script to read this data and prepare a table for later use.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/The save command in R saves objects into what is called an rda file.png)
Call the new file wrangle-data.R. The content of this file will be this.  Again know that we're using relative paths exclusively.  In this file we introduce a command we have not yet seen.  It's the command "save."  The "save" command in R saves objects into what is called an "rda file."  RDA stands for R Data.  [][We recommend using the .rda suffix on files saving R objects].  You will also see others using the suffix .RData.  This is fine.  We prefer .rda.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/if you run this code, the process data object will be saved in rda directory.png)
OK, now if you run this code, the process data object will be saved in a file in the rda directory.  Although not the case here, this approach is often practical because generating the data object we use for final analysis and plots can be complex and time consuming.  So we don't have to run it every time we start the project.  So we run this process one time and save the file.
But we still want to be able to generate the entire analysis from the raw data.  So we include that script as well.  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/We're going to call this one analysis.R..png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/analysis.R file content should be something like this.png)
Now we're ready to write the analysis file.  We're going to call this one analysis.R. The content should be something like this.  If you run this analysis, you'll see that it generates a file.  Now suppose we want to save the generated file for use in a report or a presentation.  We can do this using the command, []["ggsave."]  
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/the command ggsave to save the plot.png)
![](C:/Users/qp/Pictures/you type mkdir figs and now you can add the line ggsave.png)
This is part of the ggplot package.  But where do we put this graph?  We should be systematically organized so we will save plots to a directory called, "figs."  So we have to create this directory.  You can do this by opening a terminal.  You'll be in your working directory.  You type [][mkdir figs] and now you can add the line [][ggsave("figs/barplot.png")] to our script and it will save the file to that directory.  If you run the script now, a png file will be saved into this figs directory.  

Now if we want to copy that file to some other directory where we're developing a presentation, we can avoid using the mouse by using the copy command.  You now have a self-contained analysis in one directory.  **One final recommendation is to create a README.txt file describing what each of these files does for the benefit of others reading your code, including your future self**.  This would not be a script, but just some notes.  Note that one of the options for opening a new file in RStudio, is a text file.  You can save something like this to a text file describing what each file does and what it produces.

[][Key points]

    Ideally, files (code, data, output) should be structured and self-contained
    In a project, we prefer using relative paths (path relative to the default working directory) instead of the full path so that code can run smoothly on other individual's computers.
    It is good practice to write a README.txt file to introduce the file structure to facilitate collaboration and for your future reference.


Code

########### In terminal ###########
cd ~    # move to home directory
mkdir projects    # make a new directory called projects
cd projects    # move to ~/projects directory
mkdir murders    # make new directory called murders inside of projects
cd murders    # move to ~/projects/murders/
mkdir data rda    # make two new directories, one is data the other is rda folder
ls    # to check if we indeed have one data folder and one rda folder
pwd    # check the current working directory
mkdir figs    # make a directory called figs to store figures

########## In RStudio ########
# pick existing directory as new project
getwd()    # to confirm current working directory
save()    # save into .rda file, .RData is also fine but less preferred
ggsave("figs/barplot.png")    # save a plot generated by ggplot2 to a dir called "figs"

Assume you are in a directory called videos, which is a subdirectory of the home directory.
What is the relative path to the directory photos, which is also a subdirectory of the home directory?
../photos
~photos
..rafa/photos
./photos
correct

Explanation

To return to the parent directory, in this case the home directory, we use .., and from there we can use /photos to move to the photos subdirectory.

It is important to know which directory, or folder, you’re in when you are working from the command line in Unix. Which line of code will tell you the current working directory?
cd
pwd
rm
echo
correct
Answer
Correct: Correct! This command stands for “print working directory” and it will tell you the full path to the directory you’re currently in.
You have used 1 of 2 attempts Some



##  Question 2
1/1 point (graded)
You can’t use your computer’s mouse in a terminal. How can you see a line of code that you executed previously?
Type pwd
Type echo
Use the up arrow
Press the enter key
correct
Answer
Correct: Correct! You can use the up arrow to see previously executed lines of code and repeat them.
You have used 1 of 2 attempts Some



##  Question 3
1/1 point (graded)

Assume a student types pwd and gets the following output printed to the screen: /Users/student/Documents.

Then, the student enters the following commands in sequence:

      mkdir projects
cd projects
    

What will be printed to the screen if the student types pwd after executing the two lines of code shown above?
/Users/student/Documents
/Users/student/Documents/projects
/Users/student
cd: projects: No such file or directory
correct
Answer
Correct: Correct! The student created a new directory called “projects” and then moved into that directory using the “change directory” (cd) command.
You have used 1 of 2 attempts Some



##  Question 4
1/1 point (graded)
Which of the following statements does NOT correctly describe the utility of a command in Unix?
The
key exits the viewer when you use less to view a file.
The command ls lists files in the current directory.
The command mkdir makes a new directory and moves into it.
The mv command can move a file and change the name of a file.
correct
Answer
Correct: Correct! The mkdir command makes a new directory but does not automatically move into it. You must use the cd command to change into the new directory.
You have used 1 of 2 attempts Some



##  Question 5
1/1 point (graded)

The following is the full path to a homework assignment file called "assignment.txt": /Users/student/Documents/projects/homeworks/assignment.txt.
Which line of code will allow you to move the assignment.txt file from the “homeworks” directory into the parent directory “projects”?
mv assignment.txt
mv assignment.txt .
mv assignment.txt ..
mv assignment.txt /projects
correct
Answer
Correct: Double dots .. mean “up a directory”, so mv assignment.txt .. moves the assignment text file into the NEXT highest directory, projects.
You have used 1 of 2 attempts Some



##  Question 6
1/1 point (graded)

You want to move a file called assignment.txt into your projects directory. However, there is already a file called "assignment.txt" in the projects directory.
What happens when you execute the “move” (mv) command to move the file into the new directory?
The moved "assignment.txt" file replaces the old "assignment.txt" file that was in the "projects" directory with no warning.
An error message warns you that you are about to overwrite an existing file and asks if you want to proceed.
An error message tells you that a file already exists with that name and asks you to rename the new file.
The moved “assignment.txt” file is automatically renamed “assignment.txt (copy)” after it is moved into the “projects” directory.
correct
Answer
Correct: Correct! Be careful when moving files around using the command line. Unix does not warn you before you overwrite a file.
You have used 1 of 2 attempts Some problems have options such as save, reset, hints, or show answer. These options follow the Submit button.
Correct (1/1 point)
